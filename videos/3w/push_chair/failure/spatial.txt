The chair is positioned away from the table, and the task requires moving the chair towards the table until they make contact. The labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist frame's X-axis points approximately towards the right side of the table from the chair, the Y-axis points roughly forward away from the robot base, and the Z-axis points upwards roughly opposite gravity. The task requires moving the chair in a direction that is aligned with the wrist X-axis.
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved primarily along the negative X-axis, and the Y and Z axes must have no motion.
