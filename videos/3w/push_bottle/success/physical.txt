Mass of bottle (m) = 0.2 kg, desired displacement (d) = 0.1 m, static friction coefficients (μ_table = 0.3, μ_gripper = 0.4), gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s^2. - Relevant equations: F_friction = μ * F_normal, F = m * a, d = 0.5 * a * t^2 - Relevant assumptions: The pushing force is applied horizontally. The table is level. The bottle does not tip over. - Computations: 1. The normal force due to gravity is F_gravity = m * g = 0.2 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 1.962 N. The friction force opposing motion is F_friction = μ_table * F_gravity = 0.3 * 1.962 N = 0.5886 N. 2. To move the bottle 0.1 m in 2 seconds, we can find the required acceleration. d = 0.5 * a * t^2 => 0.1 m = 0.5 * a * (2 s)^2 => a = 0.05 m/s^2. 3. Required force: F = m * a = 0.2 kg * 0.05 m/s^2 = 0.01 N (This is the net force). 4. The robot must overcome friction, thus it must add this force. Therefore, the total force needed is F_total = F_friction + F = 0.5886 N + 0.01 N = 0.5986 N.
