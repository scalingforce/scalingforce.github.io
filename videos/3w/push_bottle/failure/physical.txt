Relevant equations: F_friction = μs * F_normal, F = m * a - Relevant assumptions: The bottle is mostly empty. The table surface is relatively flat and level.
The robot maintains a constant pushing force. We're ignoring any dynamic friction effects. - Computations: 1. F_normal ≈ m * g = 0.1 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 0.981 N 2. F_friction = 0.2 * 0.981 N = 0.1962 N 3. 
To overcome static friction, the robot needs to apply a force slightly greater than this. I'll estimate 0.3N. - Force/torque motion computations with object of mass 0.1 kg and static friction coefficient of 0.2 along the surface: The robot needs to exert a force slightly greater than the friction force to initiate and maintain motion. F_friction = 0.2 * 0.981 N = 0.1962 N. A pushing force of 0.3 N should be adequate.
