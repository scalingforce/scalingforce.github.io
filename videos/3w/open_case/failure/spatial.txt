The red axis represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion to the right in the world. Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must move no displacement. The green axis represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upward in the world. Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must move upward. The blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion backward in the world. Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must move forward, away from the robot. 
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved upward and away from the robot, rotating the case around its hinges.
Wrist Motion = [0.0, 0.05, -0.03]
