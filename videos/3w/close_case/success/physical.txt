Physical Model (if applicable): - Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of the case (m) = 0.5 kg, approximate distance from handle to hinge (r) = 0.15m. 
The relevant object is the blue case with a plastic handle which has mass 0.5 kg and, with the robot gripper, has a static friction coefficient of 0.6. - The surface of interaction is the plastic hinge and the plastic base of the case which has a static friction coefficient of 0.4 with the object.
The primary motion is rotational. The force needed to overcome the hinge resistance is minimal. The friction coefficient between the plastic surfaces isn't a factor as the case closes. Wrist Force/Torque Motion Estimation: Linear X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the backward motion required to close the lid, the object in the image must exert negative force along the X-axis with magnitude 0.5 N. Linear Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon the slight downward adjustment needed to maintain contact between lid and base, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Y-axis with magnitude 0.2 N. Linear Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon the motion to the left for the closing motion, the object in the image must exert negative force along the Z-axis with magnitude 0.3 N. Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon the need to rotate the lid closed around an axis approximately aligned with the X-axis, the object in the image must exert angular clockwise torque about the X-axis with magnitude 0.8 N-m.
