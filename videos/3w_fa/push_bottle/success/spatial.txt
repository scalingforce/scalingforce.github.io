The task requires pushing the bottle forward 10 cm. The labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the wrist axes are positioned above the bottle. The Z-axis points upwards, the X-axis points to the left, and the Y-axis points downwards. The blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward and downward motion relative to the table surface in the world. Positive Z-axis motion corresponds to moving the robot's wrist and the grasped object upwards, away from the table. Negative Z-axis motion corresponds to moving the robot's wrist and the grasped object downwards, towards the table. 
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved 10cm along the Y-axis.
Wrist Motion = [0.0, 0.1, 0.0]
