The task requires pushing the chair towards the table, implying a change in the chair's position relative to the table. The labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: The wrist frame is oriented such that the X-axis points roughly forward from the back of the chair, the Y-axis points to the right, and the Z-axis points upwards. The blue axis represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the gripper (and grasped chair) vertically up or down in the world.
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved along the negative X-axis to push the chair toward the table.
Wrist Motion = [-0.5, 0.0, 0.0]
