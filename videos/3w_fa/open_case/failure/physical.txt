Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of lid (m) = 0.2 kg, Gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s^2. Estimated opening angle = 45 degrees.
Relevant equations: Torque = Force x Distance. Force due to gravity = m*g. - Relevant assumptions: The hinge is a simple pivot point. The opening motion is relatively slow.
Computations: I will estimate the torque required to lift the lid against gravity. The distance from the hinge to the center of mass is approximately 0.1 m. The force due to gravity is 0.2 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 1.962 N. Torque = 1.962 N * 0.1 m * sin(45 degrees) = 0.139 N-m. 
I will also estimate the static friction force acting along the surface. Force due to gravity = 1.962. Frictional force = 0.1 * 1.962 N = 0.1962
