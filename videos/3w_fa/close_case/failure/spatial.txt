The case is open, and the goal is to close it using the handle. The labeled wrist axes correspond to the world as such: the positive X-axis points to the left, the positive Y-axis points forward, and the positive Z-axis points upward. Therefore, motion to the "left" in the world corresponds to motion in the positive X direction relative to the wrist, motion "forward" in the world corresponds to motion in the positive Y direction relative to the wrist, and motion "upward" in the world corresponds to motion in the positive Z direction relative to the wrist.
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved with a slight downward motion along the Z-axis and a slight leftward motion along the X-axis, which causes it to rotate clockwise around the hinge and close.
Wrist Motion = [-0.01, 0.0, -0.01]
