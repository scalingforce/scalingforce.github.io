Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of the case (m = 0.5 kg), acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s^2), estimated distance from the handle to the hinge (r = 0.1 m), estimated hinge resistance torque (τ_hinge = 0.1 N-m).
Relevant equations: Force due to gravity (F_g = m * g), Torque (τ = r * F). - Relevant assumptions: The mass is evenly distributed. The hinge resistance is constant.
Computations: F_g = 0.5 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 4.905 N. We'll estimate the initial force required to overcome the hinge resistance by assuming the user applies a force to overcome the hinge.
