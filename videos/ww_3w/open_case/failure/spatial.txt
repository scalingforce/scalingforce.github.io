The red axis in the left image represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion towards the left in the workspace view, equivalent to moving the object to the right in the world frame, or, more intuitively, pushing the object away and to the right from the robot wrist. Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must have negative motion with magnitude 0.05 m, because the handle must be moved in the negative X direction to swing the case open. The green axis in the left image represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to motion upward and to the right in the workspace view, equivalent to pulling the object backwards and to the left in the world frame, or, more intuitively, shifting the object upwards relative to the robot wrist.
The right part of the image with the labeled wrist axes shows the wrist frame of the robot in a close up view, with the Z-axis pointing up, the Y-axis pointing left, and the X-axis pointing towards the robot.
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved by primarily rotating about an axis that is roughly in the Z direction by swinging the case open. 
Wrist Motion = [-0.05, 0.03, 0]
