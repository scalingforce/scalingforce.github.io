The robot's task is to grasp the handle and then open the case. The red axis in the left image represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to upward motion in the world. Negative wrist X-axis motion corresponds to downward motion in the world. Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist X-axis, the object must have negative motion with magnitude 0.1 m, because to open the blue case, the robot must lift the handle upwards, which corresponds to negative motion in the wrist X-axis. The green axis in the left image represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to rightward motion in the world. Negative wrist Y-axis motion corresponds to leftward motion in the world. Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Y-axis, the object must have no motion with magnitude 0.0 m, because there is no significant left-right translation of the handle required to open the case. The blue axis in the left image represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to forward motion in the world. Negative wrist Z-axis motion corresponds to backward motion in the world. Based off knowledge of the task and motion, in the wrist Z-axis, the object must have positive motion with magnitude 0.02 m, because the robot needs to pull the handle forward slightly to disengage the latch.
With this close up wrist view, we can update the wrist X-axis motion to move no further as the original motion estimate will suffice. With this close up wrist view, we can update the wrist Y-axis motion to move no further as the original motion estimate will suffice. With this close up wrist view, we can update the wrist Z-axis motion to move no further as the original motion estimate will suffice.
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved slightly up and forward.
Wrist Motion = [-0.1, 0.0, 0.02]
