Relevant quantities and estimates: Mass of the case m = 2.0 kg, gravity g = 9.81 m/s^2, lifting distance d = 0.1 m, latch pulling distance d_z = 0.02m, time t = 2s. - Relevant equations: F = ma, Torque = Force * distance.
Relevant assumptions: The acceleration is constant during the motion. The force required to overcome the hinge resistance is small compared to the lifting force.
Computations: The lifting force required is approximately F = mg = 2.0 * 9.81 = 19.62 N. This must be applied along the X axis. A slight pulling force may also be needed, F_z.
