he task requires the robot to close the blue case by grasping the top handle. The red axis in the workspace-view image represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the wrist to the left and right relative to the camera's perspective. Positive X-axis motion moves the wrist to the left in the camera's view, and negative X-axis motion moves it to the right. The green axis in the workspace-view image represents wrist Y-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the wrist up and down relative to the camera's perspective, into and out of the image plane. Positive Y-axis motion moves the wrist upwards out of the image, and negative Y-axis motion moves it downwards into the image. The blue axis in the workspace-view image represents wrist Z-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the wrist forwards and backwards relative to the camera's perspective. Positive Z-axis motion moves the wrist backwards/downwards away from the camera, and negative Z-axis motion moves it forwards/upwards towards the camera. 
The right part of the image with the labeled wrist axes shows the wrist frame of the robot attached to the blue case handle. The X-axis points upwards, the Y-axis points to the right, and the Z-axis points forwards away from the gripper.To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved down along the X axis to close the case, and moved away from the hinges along the Y axis in order to close the case, and no motion along the Z axis is required.
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved downwards along the X axis to close the case.
Wrist Motion = [-0.05, 0.0, 0.0]
