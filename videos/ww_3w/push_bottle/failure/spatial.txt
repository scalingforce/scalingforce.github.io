he task requires the robot to grasp the middle of the bottle and push it forward 10cm. The red axis in the left image represents wrist X-axis motion. It roughly corresponds to moving the robot's end-effector forward and backward relative to the bottle's main axis and pointing away from the robot.
With this close up wrist view, we can update the wrist X-axis motion to move 0.1m backward, since this detailed view reinforces that positive X-axis motion moves the robot away from the object. With this close up wrist view, we can update the wrist Y-axis motion to move no additional distance, since this detailed view reinforces that positive Y-axis motion moves the robot to the left relative to the bottle. With this close up wrist view, we can update the wrist Z-axis motion to move no additional distance, since this detailed view reinforces that positive Z-axis motion moves the robot upwards away from the table.
To accomplish the task in the wrist frame, the object must be moved backward 10cm along the wrist's X-axis.
Wrist Motion = [-0.1, 0.0, 0.0]
