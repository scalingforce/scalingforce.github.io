Bottle mass (m = 0.5 kg), Static friction coefficient between bottle and table (μ = 0.3), Acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.81 m/s^2). - Relevant equations: F_friction = μ * F_normal, F_normal = m * g
Relevant assumptions: The bottle is pushed at a constant speed. Air resistance is negligible. The center of mass of the bottle is located at its geometric center.
Computations: F_normal = 0.5 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 4.905 N, F_friction = 0.3 * 4.905 N = 1.4715 N
