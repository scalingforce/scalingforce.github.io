Mass of the case = 1.0 kg, static friction coefficient between the gripper and handle mu = 0.5, hinge resistance torque (τ_hinge) = 0.5 Nm (estimated)
The normal force (N) is approximately equal to the weight of the lid, N = m*g = 1.0 kg * 9.81 m/s^2 = 9.81 N. Total torque required: τ_total = τ_hinge + τ_g = 0.5 Nm + 0.49 Nm = 0.99 Nm ≈ 1.0 Nm. - Force required at the handle to achieve this torque (assuming the handle is 0.1 m from the hinge): F_handle = τ_total / 0.1 m = 10 N.
