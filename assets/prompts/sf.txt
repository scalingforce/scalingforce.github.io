The robot-wrist view labeled with the axes of motion relative to the wrist of the robot. This close up view of the wrist may help understand more precise wrist-relative motion, especially since the wrist will be attached, via the robot end-effector, directly to the object and moving it.
World Motion Reference: {world_reference}
Use physical reasoning to complete the following plan in a structured format. First look at the workspace-view image to carefully map the required motion in the world to the required motion, forces, and torques at the wrist.
However, the labelled wrist coordinate frames will likely differ or even be opposite of this description, so we must carefully analyze the images to understand the mapping of wrist motion to the world.
Do not overfit to the wrist view, as it is not a global perspective. For example, even though the wrist-view red X-axis points up the image, does not necessarily mean that the wrist X-axis corresponds to upward motion. The workspace view is more global and should help determine world motion, primarily, and the wrist view is more local. Use the wrist view to clarify ambiguities in the workspace view if motion is not clear.

The image with the labeled wrist axes shows the wrist frame of the robot {{DESCRIPTION: describe the wrist frame and its axes of motion}}. Now, with an understanding of wrist-relative motion in the world from the workspace view, we can potentially provide more accurate wrist-relative motion by analyzing the wrist-view image.

Force/Torque Motion Estimation:
Linear X-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {{DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}}, the robot must exert on the object in the image {{CHOICE: [leftward, rightward, no]}} force along the X-axis with magnitude {{PNUM}} N.
Linear Y-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {{DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}}, the robot must exert on the object in the image {{CHOICE: [backward, forward, no]}} force along the Y-axis with magnitude {{PNUM}} N.
Linear Z-axis:  To complete the task and based upon {{DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}}, the robot must exert on the object in the image {{CHOICE: linear [upward, downward, no]}} force along the Z-axis with magnitude {{PNUM}} N.
Angular X-axis: To complete the task and based upon {{DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}}, the robot must exert on the object in the image {{CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]}} torque about the X-axis with magnitude {{PNUM}} N-m.
Angular Y-axis: To complete the task and based upon {{DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}}, the robot must exert on the object in the image {{CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]}} torque about the Y-axis with magnitude {{PNUM}} N-m.
Angular Z-axis: To complete the task and based upon {{DESCRIPTION: reasoning about and estimation of task physical properties}}, the robot must exert on the object in the image {{CHOICE: angular [counterclockwise, clockwise, no]}} torque about the Z-axis with magnitude {{PNUM}} N-m.

Python Code with Final Motion Plan:
```python
# succinct text description of the explicit estimated physical properties of the object, including mass, material, friction coefficients, etc.
property_description = "{{DESCRIPTION: describe succinctly the object and its properties}}"
# succinct text description of the motion plan along the world axes
world_motion_description = "{{DESCRIPTION: the object's required position motion in the world frame to accomplish the task}}"
# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of motion across the motion direction axes [x, y ,z]. 
world_motion_vector = [{{NUM}}, {{NUM}}, {{NUM}}]
# the vector (sign of direction * magnitude) of the forces and torques along the [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz] axes
ft_vector = [{{NUM}}, {{NUM}}, {{NUM}}, {{NUM}}, {{NUM}}, {{NUM}}]
# the grasping force, which must be positive
grasp_force = {{PNUM}}
# the task duration, which must be positive
duration = {{PNUM}}
```
[end of motion plan]

Rules:
1. Replace all {{DESCRIPTION: ...}}, {{PNUM}}, {{NUM}}, and {{CHOICE: ...}} entries with specific values or statements. For example, {{PNUM}} should be replaced with a number like 0.5. This is very important for downstream parsing!!
2. Use best physical reasoning based on known robot/environmental capabilities. Remember that the robot may have to exert forces in additional axes compared to the motion direction axes in order to maintain contacts between the object, robot, and environment.
3. Always include motion for all axes of motion, even if it's "No motion required."
4. Keep the explanation concise but physically grounded. Prioritize interpretability and reproducibility.
5. Use common sense where exact properties are ambiguous, and explain assumptions.
6. Do not include any sections outside the start/end blocks or add non-specified bullet points.
7. Make sure to provide the final python code for each requested force in a code block. Remember to fully replace the placeholder text with the actual values!
8. Do not abbreviate the prompt when generating the response. Fully reproduce the template, but filled in with your reasoning.
9. Make sure to refer to the provided correspondence in the direction guide between motion in the world frame and positive/negative motion in the respective axes.
